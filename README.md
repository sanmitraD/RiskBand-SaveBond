# RiskBand-SaveBond

A gadget to help the person in danger.
A modern rakhi.

## why is it needed?

When a person is in need,
they may not be in a condition to use our mobile.
their may scream may not reach the people who can help them.
they may not even think sensibly to take an action.

We want to help them, and want to provide a simple revolutionising solution to help them.

## Idea of the project

The idea is to create a wrist band which has the capability to sense the condition of the person and can help the individual by sending information to the people who can help them.
* Want to use long range and low power iot technologies like LoraWAN in the wrist band.
* Want to sense the various factors of body, when they reach certain level the notification will be sent automatically to the cloud.
* And it also sends notifications when the push button present on it is pressed for three times in seconds gap.
* Want to create a strong location based community and want to send notifications to them when anyone near to them are in need.
* Want to send high prioritised notifications to police department and also to the police who are near to the place of incident.
* Want to make it as small as possible so that it can be placed in any small ornament.
